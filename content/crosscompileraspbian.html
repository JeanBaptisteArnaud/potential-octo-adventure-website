title: Cross-Compiles Pharo for Raspbian
---
If you are not familiar with the usual PharoVM building process do not worry. This page will explain all the requirement step by step.
For the following when speak about root it is the root of your project.

Here you will finds [https://github.com/JeanBaptisteArnaud/pharoCCRaspbianScripts.git](https://github.com/JeanBaptisteArnaud/pharoCCRaspbianScripts.git), scripts doing everything for you just edit the config.sh file and after

~~~~~~~~ bash
sh configBuilder.sh
sh build.sh
~~~~~~~~ 

I now look into the qemu emulation to avoid using a connected raspberrypi.

But here all the install process explained step by step.

# Configure the builder

First of all you will need

+ [Cmake](http://www.cmake.org/)
+ [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and subversion
+ sshfs: how install it depend of your platform

## Install the differents toolchains
We use 2 differents toolchains: the cross-compilation tool from raspberrypi, and asasm a assembly compiler from RiscOS to compile the FastBltBit code.

### raspberrypi tools
Here is the link to the github repository
: https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git

~~~~~~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git
~~~~~~~~ 

I encounter some versionning problem with the toolchain, so I freeze the version to a previous one. This one should working:

~~~~~~~~ bash
cd tools
git checkout 9c3d7b6ac692498dd36fec2872e0b55f910baac1 .
~~~~~~~~ 

### AsAsm is assembly compiler use to compile FastBltBit,
here is the link to the svn, svn://svn.riscos.info/gccsdk/trunk
I encounter some difficulty to rebuild it correctly for an unix computer 
So here is a link to working version that I have extract:
[AsAsm unix](https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/view/ARM-Tools/job/asasm/)
This executable should be added to your path.

## Create your build environment
Here is the build environment clone the main Pharo repository
https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-vm

The following script will clone the repository build a newImage generator:

~~~~~~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-vm
cd pharo-vm/image/
sh newImage.sh
~~~~~~~~ 

Now you have a generator.image in your folder.

## Configure the Raspbian

Install [Raspbian](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest) 
or use [NOOB](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/NOOBS_latest) (an all in one installer).

Here is the tricky part, first you will need to install all the library required, as if you just compile the vm. 
But you need for some of them rewrite the from absolute to relative path, because the scripts do not have been design to be used as a mounted platform.
So here is the list of the fixes:

~~~~~~~~ bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
~~~~~~~~

Now, we will fix some lib problem :-). So as we cross compile / is not root for the library point of view. Some LD script write with absolute path should be rewrite.

~~~~~~~~ bash
sudo echo "/* GNU ld script
	Use the shared library, but some functions are only in
	the static library, so try that secondarily.	*/
OUTPUT_FORMAT(elf32-littlearm)
GROUP (../../../lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libpthread.so.0 ./libpthread_nonshared.a)" > /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libpthread.so

sudo echo "/* GNU ld script
	Use the shared library, but some functions are only in
	the static library, so try that secondarily.	*/
OUTPUT_FORMAT(elf32-littlearm)
GROUP (../../../lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc.so.6 ./libc_nonshared.a AS_NEEDED ( ../../../lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ld-linux-armhf.so.3))" > /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libpthread.so
~~~~~~~~

And finally fix the some link to library that are not correctly set:

~~~~~~~~ bash
 cd /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/
 sudo ln -s libSM.so.6 libSM.so
 sudo ln -s libICE.so.6 libICE.so
~~~~~~~~

Your raspberry should be ready to be used :-).


## Do your changes
In projectRoot/pharo-vm/image
you can do:

~~~~~~~~ bash
 ./pharo-ui generator.image
~~~~~~~~

Using VMMaker, you can change the Virtual machine by changing the Interpreter (StackInterpreter by default for now), or the configuration StackCrossRaspbianFastBltConfig.
Do a subtype of StackInterpreter or StackCrossRaspbianFastBltConfig is recommended to layered your changes.

The usual entry points are defaultInternalPlugins/defaultExternalPlugins and interpreterClass.
So do your changes.

# Building process

First of all, mount the RaspberryPi for be able to found the library.

~~~~~~~~ bash
mkdir mnt_rpi
sshfs pi@AddressOfYourPi:/ projectRoot/mnt_rpi/
~~~~~~~~ 

## Generate the source files

~~~~~~~~ bash
cd image
./pharo generator.image eval "PharoSVMBuilder new buildRaspberryPiFBB."
~~~~~~~~
Or if you extend the StackCrossRaspbianFastBltConfig configuration.

~~~~~~~~ bash
cd image
./pharo generator.image eval "MyCustomConfig new  
		generateSources; generate."
~~~~~~~~

## Builds
And finally build the project using cmake, but as we compile for another platform we need to configure a toolchain 

~~~~~~~~ bash
cd root/pharo-vm/build

sh ../scripts/extract-commit-info.sh

echo "
SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 1)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)

SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER projectRoot/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc)
SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER projectRoot/tools/aarm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++)

# where is the target environment - we mounted it using sshfs
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH projectRoot/mnt_rpi)

# search for programs in the build host directories
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
# for libraries and headers in the target directories
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
" >> toolchainRaspPi.cmake

cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchainRaspPi.cmake .
make
~~~~~~~~

Fame, Success, Girls, lost 5 sanity points.
