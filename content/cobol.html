#  Cobol Island Grammar
This project project has been done for a company [Synectique](http://www.synectique.eu/en/). In that context I am not authorized to publish any detail of the implementation. The goal is to create a coherent [Moose](http://www.moosetechnology.org/) model for IBM* ILE* COBOL/400* language. This Moose model should be used to make quality visualization for legacies software. This project has been based on [PetitParser](http://www.moosetechnology.org/tools/petitparser).

## What I do:
+ Learn the IBM* ILE* COBOL/400* language (~600 pages of a documentation). COBOL is a [non-structured language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-structured_programming).
+ Write more that 15 island parser (and more than 30 grammars) using petit parser.
+ Created, Used and Publish using Inria Continuous Integration Server (based on Jenkins).
+ Write functionales tests (~150 tests). I do not write unit tests. 
+ Create the moose Entities(~ 15 classes) specific to the language (Moose has been design for object-oriented languages). 

## Specific Effort:
+ The language itself. This language is easy to write but a pain to parse.
+ Performances, here we speak about several million of lines of codes. So, some design has been done to raised the performance. We also generated benchmark based on the test.
+ Maintainability of my code, my parser a completly modular and can be easily change. Most of the test are present to explain the _subtility_ of the language.

## Result
The project has been declared as usable by Synectique. My parsers represent just a Island Grammar of Cobol.
Now, Synectique Use my model to:
+ Detect dead code.
+ Draw the call tree.
+ Check the variable usages.


## Cumulated effort: 
	6 month.
