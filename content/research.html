Since October 2009, I'm  PhD student at INRIA Lille in the RMod team direct by Stephane Ducasse. The goal of RMoD is to support remodularization of object-oriented applications. This objective is tackled from two complementary perspectives: reengineering and modularity constructs for programming languages.

##Scientific Interest
+ Language design
+ Security
+ Reflective programming / Reflection
+ Dynamic languages

##Phd Topic
Ensure: reconciling reflection and security
Keywords : dynamic languages, reflective programming, open-system, security, capabilities, language design, virtual machine Scientific context.

More and more applications require dynamic behavior, often based on the possibility to modify the execution itself. Such changes of behavior are often based on reflective features. Dynamic scripting-like languages get more and more presence: Languages like Lua gets embedded in Adobe Photoshop, F-Script can be embedded in any Cocoa Mac OS X applications and take control of the applications without any control, Javascript applications share the same execution environment in a web-browser, so malicious ads could easily access private data. In languages such as Ruby, Python, Smalltalk, it is possible to nearly change any aspect of an applications: load untrusted code, change objects… which is clearly a total lack of security. There are some approaches to control code execution but this is often based on a closed world assumption, limited to resources control or a minimal subset of Java bytecode.  The goal of this PhD is to study how it is possible to reconcile dynamic and reflective languages with secure applications. The idea is not to validate bytecodes as this is often done but to evaluate how by construction and control of reflective features it is possible to control and create sandbox for programs execution.
