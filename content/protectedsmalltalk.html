# Protected Smalltalk

This project is a proof of concept.

## Main idea
The goal of this project is to implement the access modifiers _protected_ and _private_ for methods in Pharo. We take the most naive and simple approach. Threes Methods dictionary, one private, one protected and one public. two separated send process in virtual machine,  _self send_ and the _object send_. The _object send_ will do the normal lookup begin in the public method dictionary. And the _self send_ will search first in the private method dictionary then continue the lookup by searching in the protected method dictionary of the super class.
Note that super send should lookup in protected dictionary.

## SelfSend or ObjectSend.
First of all, how detect the difference between _self send_ and _object send_, compiler can do that easily we just need a special Bytecode for that, we extends [Opal Compiler](../opalcompiler/) to do that. We search in the virtual machine one of the last bytecode unused (one of the newspeak virtual machine: 139).
I basically do my own bytecode generator with a small pending mecanisme for detect the _self send_ case. 

I also extends the Compilation process to install the compiled methods in corrects dictionaries. 

## Limit of the model
The virtual machine is a wall that is a cool property for security purpose, but as far we can manipulate all the image content this property is more or less useless.
Then we can dynamically add some method in public dictionary, if we do not control reference in the environmnent security approach are [DOOOOoom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bbIBs0P2t0). For more information about that read my [PhD](../phd/).

Another limit of the model is represented by this code:

~~~~~~~~ smalltalk
	| mySelf | 
	"1"
	self foo. "I am Self send"
	
	"2"
	obj foo. "I am object send"
	
	"3"
	mySelf := self.
	mySelf foo. "I am object send !!!!!"
	
~~~~~~~~

+ Case 1: _self send_ easily detected, it is a normal case.
+ Case 2: _object send_ easily detected, it is a normal case.
+ Case 3: here we detect an _object send_, yes it is ugly to code like that but it is a limit that should be underline.


## Status
Need to write tests and test the implementation. [Continuous integration server](https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/view/ProtectedSmalltalk/) is set up and generate correctly the virtual machine and the image side.

## Cumulated effort: 
	2 days.
	
	
# Protected Smalltalk, from Camille Teruel
Camille Teruel (a PhD student of the Rmod team), propose a seperated approach for managing scope, completly implemented in image side. I delegate to Camille the explaination, but basically it is a cool idea :-).

## Status
 The private visibility (for method) have been implemented and work (with small bug).
And the code can be found and follow at: [PrivateMethods](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~CamilleTeruel/PrivateMethods)

## Cumulated effort: 
	1 day ( pair program with Camillle).
